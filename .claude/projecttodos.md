## Data Quality

### Validation
- [ ] Create test suite for various document types
- [ ] Validate extraction consistency across similar docs
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty docs, corrupted PDFs, non-English)
- [ ] Benchmark extraction quality vs manual labeling

### Improvements
- [ ] Fine-tune extraction prompts per document type
- [ ] Add confidence scores for extracted fields
- [ ] Implement human-in-the-loop validation
- [ ] Create feedback mechanism for incorrect extractions

## Infrastructure

### Performance
- [ ] Optimize chunking strategy for better retrieval
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed documents
- [ ] Add CDN for static assets
- [ ] Optimize Weaviate query performance

### Scaling
- [ ] Plan for 1000+ document ingestion
- [ ] Implement queue system for async processing
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Set up database backups

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-document relationship extraction (e.g., link term sheet to cap table)
- [ ] Temporal tracking (track company metrics over time)
- [ ] Cross-company benchmarking
- [ ] Automated insight generation from trends

### AI Improvements
- [ ] Implement active learning for field discovery
- [ ] Add entity linking across documents
