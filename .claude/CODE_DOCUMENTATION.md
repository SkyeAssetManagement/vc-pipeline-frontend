## Architecture & Design

### Core Components

#### 1. Search System (`/api/search-optimized`)
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines keyword (BM25) and semantic vector search
- **Query Enhancement**: Automatic expansion with relevant financial terms
- **Result Processing**: Deduplication, confidence scoring, financial extraction
- **AI Synthesis**: Claude generates contextual answers with source citations

#### 2. Enhanced Braintrust Integration
- **Automatic Tracing**: All AI operations logged to VeronaAI project with rich metadata
- **Custom Scoring Metrics**: Relevance, completeness, accuracy, response time, token efficiency
- **Advanced Features**: Nested operations, error tracking with stack traces, user/session tracking
- **Integration Methods**:
  - Enhanced tracing (`lib/braintrust-enhanced.ts`) with custom scoring
  - Simple logging (`lib/braintrust-simple.ts`) for basic operations
  - Direct SDK (`lib/braintrust.ts`) for core functionality
  - Vercel AI SDK wrapper (`lib/claude-vercel-ai.ts`) for streaming
- **Test Framework**: Comprehensive test endpoints for validation and debugging

#### 3. Optimized Weaviate Service (`lib/weaviate-optimized.ts`)
- **Primary Collection**: `VC_PE_Claude97_Optimized_Production` (enhanced schema)
- **Legacy Collection**: `VC_PE_Claude97_Production` (fallback compatibility)
- **Search Modes**: Semantic (BM25), hybrid, filtered search with financial criteria
- **Enhanced Schema**: Structured financial data extraction with Claude analysis
- **Field Filtering**: Company, document type, industry, investment amounts, valuations, ownership
- **Confidence Scoring**: Extraction confidence with quality thresholds
- **Statistics & Analytics**: Comprehensive document and financial metrics

### Enhanced Data Flow
1. User submits natural language query via `/api/search-optimized`
2. Query enhanced with VC/PE financial context and keywords
3. Weaviate performs intelligent search (hybrid/semantic/filtered) on optimized collection
4. Results processed with structured financial data extraction
5. Company grouping and financial aggregation
6. Claude synthesizes contextual answer with source citations
7. All operations traced to Braintrust with custom scoring metrics
8. Response returned with confidence levels, metadata, and performance scores

## Data Schema

### Enhanced Search Result Structure
```typescript
interface SearchResult {
  id: string
  company: string
  industry: string
  documentType: string
  content: string
  claudeExtraction: string

  // Financial Data (from optimized schema)
  investmentAmount: number
  preMoneyValuation: number
  postMoneyValuation: number
  fairValue: number
  ownershipPercentage: number

  // Content Analysis Flags
  hasInvestmentAmount: boolean
  hasValuation: boolean
  hasOwnership: boolean
  hasFairValue: boolean

  // Quality Metrics
  extractionConfidence: number
  score: number
  chunkId: string
}
```

### Enhanced AI Response Format
```typescript
interface AIResponse {
  success: boolean
  query: string
  enhancedQuery: string
  results: SearchResult[]
  companyGroups: CompanyGroup[]
  aiAnswer: string
  confidence: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  sources: Source[]
  totalResults: number
  searchType: string
  filters: FilterCriteria
