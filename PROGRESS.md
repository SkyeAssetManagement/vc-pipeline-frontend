**Status:** âœ… Foundation Complete

#### âœ… Completed Tasks:
1. **Project Setup & Architecture**
   - âœ… Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
   - âœ… Complete dependency installation (27+ packages including Weaviate, Framer Motion, React Query)
   - âœ… Project structure with organized directories (`components/`, `lib/`, `types/`, `config/`)
   - âœ… Configuration files (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, PostCSS)

2. **Core Infrastructure**
   - âœ… Weaviate vector database configuration with OpenAI embeddings
   - âœ… Complete TypeScript type definitions (`Company`, `Document`, `Investment`, `SearchQuery`)
   - âœ… Weaviate service layer with semantic and hybrid search methods
   - âœ… Utility functions and custom hooks (`useDebounce`, formatters)
   - âœ… Environment variables setup

3. **UI Components & Features**
   - âœ… **Natural Language Search Bar** (Primary Feature)
     - Large, prominent search input with AI sparkle icon
     - Real-time query suggestions and auto-completion
     - Advanced filters panel (date range, investment amounts, document types, stages)
     - Example VC-specific queries ("Show me Series A rounds above $2M")
     - Framer Motion animations and responsive design
     - Mock search results display with realistic data
   - âœ… **Landing Page**
     - Professional VeronaAI branding
     - Feature showcase (Semantic Search, Portfolio Analytics, Document Management)
     - Integrated search bar as centerpiece
     - Dark mode support

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - âœ… Modern React patterns with hooks and TypeScript
   - âœ… Performance optimizations (debounced search, memoization)
   - âœ… Error handling and loading states
   - âœ… Git repository setup and GitHub integration

#### ðŸš€ Current Status:
- **Development Server:** Running on `http://localhost:3001`
- **Repository:** Connected to GitHub at `https://github.com/SkyeAssetManagement/vc-pipeline-frontend`
- **Build Status:** âœ… Compiling successfully
- **Core Functionality:** Natural language search interface ready for user interaction

#### ðŸ“‹ Next Priority Tasks:
1. **API Routes Implementation**
   - `/api/search/route.ts` - Weaviate search endpoints
   - `/api/companies/route.ts` - Company data management
   - `/api/export/route.ts` - Data export functionality

2. **Dashboard Components**
   - Portfolio statistics dashboard
   - Company cards with metrics display
   - Data visualization components (charts, graphs)

3. **Document Management**
   - Document library interface
   - PDF viewer integration
   - Document upload and processing

#### ðŸ”§ Technical Debt & Improvements:
- Security audit for API keys (currently in config for development)
- Add comprehensive error boundaries
- Implement proper loading skeletons
- Add unit tests for search functionality

#### ðŸ“Š Metrics:
- **Files Created:** ~20 core files
- **Components:** 1 major (SearchBar), multiple utilities
- **Dependencies:** 27+ packages installed
- **Code Quality:** TypeScript strict mode, ESLint configured
- **Git Commits:** Foundation and search implementation

â”œâ”€â”€ app/                    # Next.js 14 app directory
â”œâ”€â”€ components/            # React components organized by feature
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/                   # Utilities, hooks, services
â”œâ”€â”€ types/                 # TypeScript definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                # Configuration files
â””â”€â”€ .env.local            # Environment variables
```

### Key Technologies
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Database:** Weaviate vector database with OpenAI embeddings
- **State Management:** React hooks, React Query for server state
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Forms:** React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Important Notes
- Weaviate and OpenAI credentials are configured in `.env.local`
- Search functionality is implemented but needs API route integration
- Component architecture follows modern React patterns
- All types are properly defined for full TypeScript coverage
